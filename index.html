				Responsive Redesign - Lexington, MA Teachers' Union Website
			</h1>
			<h2>
				Project Description
			</h2>
			<img src="Images/LEA_Website_Current.png" class="img-fluid"
				alt="Screenshot of current Lexington Education Association Webpage">
			<p>
				This website was created for the Responsive Redesign assignment in Brown University's User
				Interface/User Experience course.
				I chose to recreate this website as it is the website for the teachers' union that my mom belongs to. I
				hope that this Redesign
				can potentially be implemented on the actual website and can help others learn more about the important
				work that the Lexington
				Public School Teachers' Union does for its members, their students, and the Lexington, MA community.
				<a href="https://lexington.massteacher.org/" class="btn btn-lg btn-warning" role="button">View the original website here!</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				To create this project, I:
			<ol>
				<li>Analyzed the current usability and accessibility of the website</li>
				<li>Created low-fidelity mockups of the website using wireframes</li>
				<li>Constructed a visual-design style guide for the website, integrating Lexington's colors and mascot
					into the design.</li>
				<li>Mocked up a high-fidelity prototype of the website using Figma.</li>
				<li>Coded the final website (which you are on right now) using CSS and HTML.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>
				Usability Problem Identification
			</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Top header renders in low resolution
						in some
						places, and also does not include an image description</li>
					<li>Twitter sidebar confuses reader about
						where to first look
						when navigating the page</li>
					<li>Logo positioning at the top of the website makes it hard to tell where relevant information is.
					</li>
					<li>Hard to differentiate between
						sections of the website
						&mdash; What we do vs. who we are</li>
					<li> Bulleted lists are very long and hard
						to skim; hard
						to parse out information from the list</li>
					<li>Navbar conceptual model makes sense;
						however clicking some headings takes you to pages while some others are just placeholders that allow drop-downs to appear. Drop-downs are overwhelming.</li>
					<li> Font of headings often hard to read, especially for the character 'W'</li>
					<li>Websiteâ€™s color scheme does not represent the brand of the union or the school district
						(blue/yellow)</li>

				<h2>
					Accessibility Problem Identification
				</h2>
				<p> I found a couple of accessibility problems as well by WebAIM WAVE. I found that the algorithm
					pointed out some interesting nuances about the
					webpage, such as the contrast, that I had not previously considered and I believe are incredibly
					important to fix to ensure people can access the union's important resources. However, I was happy
					to see that this website, which is used by many, did not have many
					accessibility problems to begin with, and I did not notice any accessibility concerns that the
					algorithm did not point out.</p>
				<li>The websites' images do not include image descriptions, making it difficult for screenreaders to
					parse through the website.</li>
				<li>Website's html code has no heading 2's</li>

			<h3> Lo-Fi Wireframes
				<p>
					To start to redesign the website, I created a low-fidelity wireframe which solved the problems that
					I had flagged in the
					'usability problems identification' and 'accessibility problem identification' sections. I did this
					for the tablet, desktop, and phone versions
					of the union website. The problems are labeled on the wireframes below; for higher-resolution versions of the wireframes, please go to the appendix at the bottom of this page.

				I created a style guide for my high-fidelity prototype, which I also used for the responsive redesign as
				well. The guide is shown below:
