				Responsive Redesign - Lexington, MA Teachers' Union Website
			</h1>
			<h2>
				Project Description
			</h2>
			<img src="Images/LEA_Website_Current.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Screenshot of current Lexington Education Association Webpage">
			<p>
				This website was created for the Responsive Redesign assignment in Brown University's User
				Interface/User Experience course.
				I chose to recreate this website as it is the website for the teachers' union that my mom belongs to. I
				hope that this Redesign
				can potentially be implemented on the actual website and can help others learn more about the important
				work that the Lexington
				Public School Teachers' Union does for its members, their students, and the Lexington, MA community.
			</p>
			<p>
				To create this project, I:
			<ol>
				<li>Analyzed the current usability and accessibility of the website</li>
				<li>Created low-fidelity mockups of the website using wireframes</li>
				<li>Constructed a visual-design style guide for the website, integrating Lexington's colors and mascot
					into the design.</li>
				<li>Mocked up a high-fidelity prototype of the website using Figma.</li>
				<li>Coded the final website (which you are on right now) using CSS and HTML.</li>
			</ol>

						Usability Problem Identification

					<div>
						<p>
							This keypad to the right of the microwave allows the user to set the settings and time for
							the use of the device (typically to heat or reheat food/drinks). The top of the microwave
							has a clock that changes to a timer display while the microwave is on. Below that is a
							cluster of presets for different types of food and then below that there is a
							numeric keypad for entering the time to cook the device. The next cluster has miscellaneous
							settings, while the bottom has buttons to start, reset, and set the microwaves functions.

			<h2> Questions and Responses
			</h2>
			<h4> What were your motivations for using the microwave’s keypad?
			</h4>
			<div>
				<ol>
					<li> Person 1: I wanted pop popcorn to eat while studying.
					</li>
					<li> Person 2: To put in the time to make my leftovers.
					</li>
					<li> Person 3: To heat up some water for some tea. </li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<h4> Which buttons do you use most? Which ones do you use least? How did you make this decision?
			</h4>
			<div>
				<ol>
					<li> I only use the popcorn button and the numeric keypad. I use the least the defrost and power
						settings. Only start, stop, minute settings.
					</li>
					<li> I use the timepad the most. Don’t get what the popcorn and potato mean. It doesn’t make sense
						to me. I also don’t get the power button. Can the microwave be stronger or weaker? I do not use
						any of these at all. I do not understand any of the buttons except the time buttons, because I
						do not trust the microwave programmer.
					</li>
					<li> I like to use the 'add one minute' function. I usually put my food into the microwave for a
						minute then check it then try it again at those one minute intervals. I never use the defrost
						features, as they confuse me. </li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<h4> Did you encounter hiccups while using the microwave? If so what?
			</h4>
			<div>
				<ol>
					<li> Not really, the main struggle I have is trying to figure out how long it will take for the
						popcorn to pop but I usually judge that by when the popcorn stops popping. </li>
					<li> I don't encounter hiccups when I stick to my timepad. </li>
					<li> I always cannot figure out the right amount of time to cook my food!</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<h4> If you could replace one feature on the microwave with another, new function, which would you replace?
			</h4>
			<div>
				<ol>
					<li> Some microwaves have a function called sensory heat, and I would use that instead of one of the
						weight features. </li>
					<li> Add a mute button so I don’t disturb other people when I make my food. </li>
					<li> To be honest, I wouldn't add any buttons, there are just so many to pick from that I feel
						overwhelmed when I approach the microwave.
						I would say goodbye easiest to the 'by weight' feature and potato cook button, however. </li>
				</ol>
